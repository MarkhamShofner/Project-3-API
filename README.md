Group(name, Github username):
* Josh Cohen, jacohen10
* Rebecca Estes, rebeccaestes
* Markham Shofner, markhamshofner
* Matt Popovich, mpopv

#### Explanations of the Technologies Used
Stack: [Express, MongoLab, CSS, HTML, Node]
Technologies: [Heroku, Github, Ajax, Yelp API, Leaflet API]

#### The Approach Taken
This was our first group project at GA, so a lot of our learning was done offline and outside of a terminal. Over the past week, we became better communicators with regards to team structure, work-streams, and project goals. Our first major chunk of time was spent discussing what we were actually going to build. Once we had an idea we determined a rough framework to achieve and MVP. Then we mapped that framework to a timeline, and began working towards it. As we progressed, our goals, action-items, and general understanding of what we were making iteratively changed as well. Eventually we hit an MVP where we were making AJAX calls to an external API (yelp business lat/longs/rankings), and paring that information with another API (leaflet mapping). Since then, the project has been about making the information shown more valuable, streamlining the user experience to be more intuitive, and adjusting the look to make the website more aesthetically appealing.

#### Installation Instructions

#### Unsolved Problems
With more time we would would users to favorite businesses or locations that appear after a query.
It would also be nice to add facebook and google login functionality.
